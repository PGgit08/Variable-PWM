# Variable-PWM
A Printed Circuit Board designed and built by Peter Gutkovich.

## Description
### How It Works (and Specs)
The Variable PWM PCB is a PCB designed and built by Peter Gutkovich. It produces a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) square-wave signal. This signal can be modified with potentiometers **VR1** and **VR2**. **VR1** changes the signal's *frequency*, which can either range from around **0.7 HZ - 7 HZ (SLOW MODE)** or **19.7 HZ - 216.7 HZ (FAST MODE)**. Switch **S1** sets the board to **FAST MODE** if it is switched to the *left*, and it sets the board to **SLOW MODE** if it is switched to the *right*. Potentiometer **VR2** controls the signal's *duty cycle* which ranges from **0% - ~100%**. LED D1 indicates the signal produced by the board by flashing on and off depending on the signal. **[Click here for in-depth explanation.](/Docs/Explanation.md)**

## How To Use the Board
**The board should be powered with a 9V Battery.** Use the **+** and **-** pins to power the board. Use the **OUT** pin for the output signal, and the **GND** pin for connecting to the *board's* ground. Information on how to use the switch and potentiometers can be found **[here](https://github.com/PGgit08/Variable-PWM#how-it-works)**.
